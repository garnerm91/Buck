# 1.5a 5v Buck Converter
This is a basic buck converter with reverse polarity protection and transient voltage protection. Used TI's Webench to design it. https://www.ti.com/design-resources/design-tools-simulation/webench-power-designer.htmls
Buck Converter from Fixed Until Broken Video. Only changes made since the video is that I removed an unused via and moved D1 a little bit from the the mounting hole.

# Assembly
Can be done in reflow oven, hot plate or with hot air. If uing a hot plate you will only be able to do one side with it and then hand soldering the rest. I would do the leds with the hot plate if that is the route you go. I used hot air and solder paste myself. Hand soldering the LM3100 without hot air or a hot plate would be hard to do due the bottom pad.
